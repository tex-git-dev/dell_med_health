 I lost my husband 10
years ago in January,

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:13.504
and he used to walk with
me just about every day.

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:15.576
He was such a sweet man.

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:18.093
There was a big tree that he loved,

00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:19.996
a big oak tree on the corner.

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:23.092
Every time I walk past
it now, I look up at it

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:25.064
and I think about him.

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:26.564
I really miss him.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.416
I just like to get out in the sunshine

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:32.932
and do things and go be outdoors.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.265
I have a friend named Betty,

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:38.301
and she walks with me a lot.

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:41.433
Betty and I, we have a good time together.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:42.855
Besides, when I walk with her,

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:45.506
I always find out all
the neighborhood gossip.

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:48.721
Yes, I have, where you go from
neighbors to neighbors, yes.

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.236
I was walking over to
her house the other day,

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:53.143
and I got about halfway there

00:00:53.143 --> 00:00:55.452
and I started getting short of breath

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:59.893
and I started getting a
pain right about here,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.119
and it was kind of scary,
so I sat down on the corner,

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.013
and I tried to pull it all together.

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:08.490
I did, and I got over there,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.871
but I realized something was wrong.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.579
Well, Patrick insisted
I go see Dr. Bennett,

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.405
my primary care provider.

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.551
I didn't want to go.

00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:21.561
 Okay, we've got some crackles.

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:23.484
Dyspnea on exertion and angina.

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:26.630
 Dr. Bennett was there,
and he said something about

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.213
dyspnea and angina.

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:30.692
I asked him what that was all about,

00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:32.292
and he said I might have a heart attack

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.839
and he wanted me to go see a cardiologist.

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:36.526
I wasn't happy at all.

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:39.178
I didn't want to hear that kind of news.

00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:41.354
I did ask Dr. Bennett, I said,

00:01:41.354 --> 00:01:43.358
"How much do you think that will cost?"

00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:45.434
He just kind of shrugged
his shoulders and says,

00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:46.684
"I don't know."

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.650
You know, I don't want to sound like

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.689
one of those little, old
ladies who's so bitter

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.381
and talks about their
health issues all the time,

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.964
but I'll be honest, I'm scared.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.916
If I can't walk again,

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:04.359
really, that's no way to live your life.
