00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:05.733
The chargemaster, also known

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.448
as the charge description master, or CDM,

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:11.223
is the list of charges
for the tens of thousands

00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:13.633
of billable items at a given hospital,

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.213
sort of like a menu at a restaurant

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:18.505
but one that is very
long and includes reams

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:23.240
of almost indiscernible
line items and details.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.372
The chargemaster is a master
list of all potential charges

00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:28.940
that can show up on a patient's bill.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.708
The amount listed for each item

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:32.638
is the amount of money that a self-pay

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:35.091
or uninsured patient is asked to pay

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:37.774
for a medical service or supply.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:39.973
Very few people, other than the uninsured,

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:43.184
or those who self-pay would receive a bill

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:45.690
with the prices directly
from the chargemaster.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.631
In general, insurance companies negotiate

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:50.375
for percentage discounts
off of the chargemaster,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.646
so that the amount a payer pays

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:56.002
is always a significant
discount from the charge.

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.034
Also, since insurance
companies usually negotiate

00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:01.674
a percentage savings from the list price,

00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:04.195
this creates the incentive for a hospital

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:06.374
to keep raising its chargemaster rates

00:01:06.374 --> 00:01:08.125
and for payers to keep pushing

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.848
for steeper discounts from those rates.

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:12.148
The chargemaster is generally used

00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:14.635
as a starting point for
closed door bargaining

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:16.753
with different commercial insurers,

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:18.803
it is theoretically meant to relate

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:21.816
to both actual hospital costs
and payments to insurers

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:24.303
but the amounts shown are so inflated,

00:01:24.303 --> 00:01:26.988
it is hard to see these connections.

00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:28.614
A study was commissioned by the Medicare

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:31.179
Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC,

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.424
it found that healthcare
delivery systems decisions

00:01:34.424 --> 00:01:36.822
about how and when to apply markups

00:01:36.822 --> 00:01:38.927
to the actual costs on the chargemaster

00:01:38.927 --> 00:01:43.019
vary widely based on an array
of idiosyncratic factors,

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.200
these include influence
of specific payers,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.125
community perception, and
ill-defined competitive forces.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.019
Hospital administrators may
defend charging practices

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:55.985
partially by pointing out that charges

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.586
rarely reflect what hospitals are paid

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.886
and that the variety
of insurance companies,

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.022
each with a variety of coverage plans,

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.134
add their fair share of complexity

00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:07.802
in pricing and reimbursements.

00:02:07.802 --> 00:02:10.084
While this may be true,
and patients rarely pay

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:12.239
the charges listed on a chargemaster,

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.076
this practice perpetuates opaque pricing

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:17.229
and adds unnecessary complexity

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.646
to an already complex system.

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:23.414
Clinicians do not set the prices

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:25.434
on chargemasters but they can advocate

00:02:25.434 --> 00:02:27.648
for a more rational
hospital pricing system

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:31.248
and can help shine a
light on hospital costs.

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:33.337
A first step may be supporting systems

00:02:33.337 --> 00:02:36.179
that provide full
transparency to patients,

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:40.012
these will be explored
further as we continue.
