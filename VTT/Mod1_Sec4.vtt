00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.508
In 2012, the Institute of Medicine

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:12.120
estimated that $750 to $765 billion

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.132
is spent each year in the
US on healthcare waste.

00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:19.000
This is likely now over one
trillion dollars each year.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:22.790
This waste represents
up to 30 cents or more

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.000
on every healthcare dollar spent.

00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:29.022
If we distributed that money
to each person in the US,

00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:31.798
every single man, woman, and child

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:35.563
would receive a little
over $3,000 every year.

00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:37.763
This level of waste 
becomes more poignant

00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:40.371
when you consider that medical
costs are a leading cause of

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:44.000
personal bankruptcy in
 the United States.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.195
To get a sense of the
scale of this problem,

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:48.278
consider these analogies.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.532
If banking were like healthcare,

00:00:51.532 --> 00:00:53.777
ATM transactions would take not seconds,

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:56.790
but perhaps days or longer as a result of

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.540
unavailable or misplaced records.

00:01:01.712 --> 00:01:03.627
If shopping were like healthcare,

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:05.827
product prices would not be posted

00:01:05.827 --> 00:01:06.886
and the price charged would

00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:08.927
vary widely within the same store

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:12.426
depending on the source of payment.

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:15.236
If automobile manufacturing
were like healthcare,

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:17.803
warranties for cars that
require manufacturers

00:01:17.803 --> 00:01:20.326
to pay for defects would not exist.

00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:22.197
As a result, few factories would seek

00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:25.171
to monitor and improve
production line performance

00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:27.005
and product quality.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.000
If airline travel were like healthcare,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.554
each pilot would be free to design

00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:33.369
his or her own preflight safety check.

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.536
Or not perform one at all.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.993
Indeed, healthcare waste is detrimental

00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:43.160
at the individual, family,
community, and national levels.
