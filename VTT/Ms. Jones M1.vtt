 My grandson takes off from work
and he drives me all over town

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:13.562
to see all of my doctors,
he's a real sweetie.

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:14.791
 Have you got everything in your purse?

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.862
 I think so, yeah.

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:19.915
You know, I do have an
awful lot of doctors too,

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:23.115
at my age, yeah, you do.

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:27.390
He wants to make sure that
everything goes right for me

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.905
so he takes me to the doctor,

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:32.621
he stays there and waits and
he gets all the information,

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:34.470
he wants me to get better.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.339
 Let's go sit down.
 Okay.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.169
 Like many elderly people,

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:43.098
Annie Jones is well aware
of the pitfalls of aging.

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:47.530
She has been diagnosed with a
number of medical conditions,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.649
congestive heart failure,
atrial fibrillation,

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.316
COPD, osteoporosis, arthritis
and chronic kidney disease.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:00.576
She is prescribed a
total of 12 medications.

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:02.112
 Medications are tough for me

00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:04.441
because there are so
many, I have at least 12

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.415
and a few of them I take twice a day

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.958
so I try to keep track of everything

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.208
and it's really hard to do.

00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:16.636
I live alone and I'm retired

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:19.293
and I'm on a fixed income

00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:23.543
and I think, right now, 
I'm up to about

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:27.185
$300 a month out of pocket expenses

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.386
and that's just for medications alone.

00:01:32.787 --> 00:01:35.723
I worry and I don't 
know what I'll do

00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:37.738
if I don't keep my insurance,

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:40.405
because they do help pay for it.

00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:43.032
 Unbeknownst to Ms. Jones,

00:01:43.032 --> 00:01:45.770
some of her brand name
prescriptions have effective

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.207
and cheaper generic
alternatives readily available.

00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:51.613
If she was aware of this,

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:55.030
she could save more than $100 each month.

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.868
Ms. Jones has multiple physicians

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:02.881
and each has their own
electronic record keeping,

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.431
one even uses paper charts.

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.400
 At 82 there are a lot
of doctors on my payroll,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.354
besides my primary care, of course,

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:14.307
there's the nephrologist,
the cardiologist,

00:02:14.307 --> 00:02:17.727
the pulmonologist, all of
these folks I have to see

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:20.991
and sometimes all within the same week

00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:22.868
and then they all want to do tests

00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:24.735
so when you see so many people,

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:27.728
sometimes you get tested
on two or three times,

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:32.205
the same exact test and
you're paying for it.

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:36.060
It's very frustrating,
it's also very tiring.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.624
 Her pulmonologist
recently scheduled her

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:41.097
for an echocardiogram
due to her chronically

00:02:41.097 --> 00:02:43.560
worsening shortness of breath.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.404
Just two weeks earlier she
underwent the same test

00:02:46.404 --> 00:02:49.452
at another facility, her
cardiologist had ordered it

00:02:49.452 --> 00:02:52.763
to check on her congestive
 heart failure.

00:02:52.763 --> 00:02:56.854
 I had an echocardiogram
and, about halfway through it,

00:02:56.854 --> 00:02:59.484
I started thinking that
I had a deja vu moment,

00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:02.371
I had just had this
thing done a few days ago

00:03:02.371 --> 00:03:04.921
and then my nephrologist, Dr. Sellers,

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:07.770
wanted to take blood and do blood work

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.968
and I realized I'd just
had blood work done

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:15.020
at my primary care doctor's,
just a week before,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.099
I haven't even gotten the
results of these tests yet.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.901
I know that they've got my
best interests at heart,

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:25.844
but the thing is, I do wish
they could talk to one another,

00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:27.927
it sure would be helpful.
