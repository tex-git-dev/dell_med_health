After receiving care
in a hospital or clinic,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.148
you may receive a survey in the mail.

00:00:13.148 --> 00:00:14.858
These surveys are often referred to

00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:17.338
as patient satisfaction surveys

00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:21.207
and they ask general questions
about the care received.

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:22.753
One failure of this method is that,

00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:24.380
after we provide care,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.861
we are essentially asking "How were we?"

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:30.778
When really we should be
asking, "How are you?"

00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:33.452
Unlike these general surveys,

00:00:33.452 --> 00:00:35.931
PROMs ask very specific questions

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:37.314
about a patient's condition

00:00:37.314 --> 00:00:40.931
at multiple intervals over
the course of treatment.

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:43.583
For a patient in need
of a hip replacement,

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:46.067
relevant questions might include

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.633
"How much pain do you have?"

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.400
"Are you able to climb stairs?"

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.640
The same questions are ideally asked both

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.122
before and after surgery to make sure

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.570
that the outcomes that the
patient originally sought

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.237
are truly being met.

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:04.038
Patients considering
surgery can then compare

00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:05.469
their own responses to those

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.303
who have already gone through it

00:01:07.303 --> 00:01:11.909
in order to decide if the
surgery is right for them.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.597
To date, some of the best
developed and studied PROMs

00:01:14.597 --> 00:01:16.953
relate to joint replacements.

00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:18.334
Early data from these efforts

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:20.204
have already brought valuable insight

00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:24.234
on the optimal timing to undergo surgery.

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:25.927
Interestingly, while most patients

00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:28.371
significantly benefit from surgery,

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:29.472
those who wait the longest

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:31.920
and are most disabled prior to surgery

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.420
do not seem to benefit at all.
