00:00:10.148 --> 00:00:14.130
I wanted to tell you why I
care so much about improvement.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.256
I wanted to tell you why I'm
so passionate about the work

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.180
that we do here and it's a
story, it's a personal story.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.478
It's about my brother Johnny.

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:26.769
I'm the oldest of nine
children, a big Irish family,

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.876
and we're all very close,
but my brother was really

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:31.411
a special kid.

00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:38.578
He was handsome and smart and
sociable and warm and nice.

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:42.467
He was hugely successful
in school and he even

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:46.505
turned out to be the ball
boy for the Boston Celtics.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:50.672
So here he is, one of the
championship teams in Boston.

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:55.951
He was a tremendous guy to be with.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.303
When he was 17, though, 
he was diagnosed

00:00:58.303 --> 00:01:01.182
with Hodgkin's disease and
 he went through

00:01:01.182 --> 00:01:04.421
lots of treatments and
I was there with him,

00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:08.131
as was the rest of the
family, throughout his care.

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:11.108
I remember though as he
got more and more sick,

00:01:11.108 --> 00:01:14.864
that he started coming up to
my apartment and he would say

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:17.807
"Maureen, I'm not gonna make it."

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:21.974
And I thought my job was to
give him hope and optimism

00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:24.495
and encouragement.

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:32.885
I thought my job was to talk
about the next treatment,

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:29.812
the next radiation
treatment or the next round

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:33.979
of chemotherapy, and I found
that I was always offering

00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:40.853
him this hope and optimism
without really understanding

00:01:40.853 --> 00:01:42.926
what he was thinking.

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:46.293
And so one day I learned
an incredible lesson

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:47.523
when he was in the hospital.

00:01:47.523 --> 00:01:51.690
It was a regular day when
all the physicians came in

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.159
and were making rounds and
walking around, talking over

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.992
his bed about his care,
and then they all left

00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.782
and one physician came back in.

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:07.324
He was a radiation oncologist
and he came back into the room

00:02:07.324 --> 00:02:12.182
and he said to my brother,
"Johnny, what do you want?"

00:02:12.182 --> 00:02:14.273
and my brother said,
 "I wanna go home."

00:02:14.273 --> 00:02:18.439
And without saying a word,
the physician came over

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.922
and he took my jacket off
me and he went and he put it

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:24.547
over my brother and he picked
him up and he carried him

00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:25.795
to my car.

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:28.477
I know he broke every
rule in the hospital.

00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:31.897
I know nurses were chasing
after him, coming down the hall,

00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:35.002
but he knew that my brother
was at the end of his life

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:37.986
and he knew that that question
was the most important

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:39.685
question that he could ask.

00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:41.333
What do you want?

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.114
So when we got my brother home,

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:46.148
I said to him the same thing.

00:02:46.148 --> 00:02:47.686
"Johnny, what do you want?"

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:50.389
And he said, "I want to be 21."

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.722
This was a few days 
before his birthday.

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:59.272
My brother turned 21 just
a couple of weeks after

00:02:59.272 --> 00:03:03.499
I brought him home, on
November 25th, and he died

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.506
on December 1st.

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:09.037
And I will always be
grateful to that physician

00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:12.633
for all these years, for
38 years I've been carrying

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:15.973
this picture around in my
purse, every single day,

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:19.521
looking at my brother and
looking at how thin and sick

00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:24.170
he was and realizing what a
difference that physician made

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.287
because for those weeks 
that he was home,

00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:29.897
he had friends and family.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:32.164
We were able to laugh.

00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:35.426
We were able to look back at
his life and enjoy every minute

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:36.721
of those weeks.

00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:38.454
If he were still in the
hospital, which is what

00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:41.794
would have happened without
that physician's courage,

00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:43.714
I know that we would
have had visiting hours

00:03:43.714 --> 00:03:45.925
and the little kids in the
family wouldn't have been able

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.401
to access him.

00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:49.716
His friends wouldn't have been
able to come and celebrate

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:52.406
in the group and my brother
would have died a very different

00:03:52.406 --> 00:03:53.561
death.

00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:59.628
So that physician told me that
one, we need to understand

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.386
what matters to you?

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:04.138
Asking that one question,
what matters to you?

00:04:04.138 --> 00:04:05.407
What do you want?

00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:08.758
Made such a difference in
his life and then we really

00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:11.487
need to understand the
constraints and the rules

00:04:11.487 --> 00:04:14.186
and really think about
how do we use improvement

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:17.325
to make every day special
for every patient?
