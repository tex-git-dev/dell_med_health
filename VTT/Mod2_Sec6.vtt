00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:10.580
Ms. Jones has been having symptoms

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.192
that suggest her heart
disease is worsening

00:00:13.192 --> 00:00:14.574
and her stress test revealed

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:18.102
that she has chronic
coronary artery disease.

00:00:18.102 --> 00:00:20.218
By the time she visits her cardiologist,

00:00:20.218 --> 00:00:21.821
the symptoms have stabilized

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.988
and are no longer worsening
in frequency or severity.

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:30.032
This is a radar chart
that depicts the outcomes

00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:33.071
and cost associated with
two treatment strategies

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:35.988
for stable coronary artery disease.

00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:41.860
One strategy is optimal
medical therapy, or OMT,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.368
which aims to manage
disease with medications

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:47.920
and lifestyle interventions alone.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.635
Another is percutaneous
coronary intervention, or PCI,

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:54.364
plus medication therapy,
which combines OMT

00:00:54.364 --> 00:00:56.322
with a non-surgical procedure

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.448
that uses a catheter to place a stent

00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:00.918
to open narrowed blood
vessels in the heart,

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:04.501
i.e. having a stent
placed in the cath lab.

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.360
The outcomes that matter to patients

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.027
with coronary artery disease

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:11.065
appear on the outer ring of the chart

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:14.134
and are adapted from
the ICHOM standard set

00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:16.019
for coronary artery disease

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:18.769
described earlier in this module.

00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:22.567
Ideal performance on each
metric is a score of 100,

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:27.041
represented by the outer
most ring of the chart,

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:30.004
in other words, points farther
from the chart's center

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.646
represent better performance.

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:34.713
Note that the reciprocal
of cost is plotted

00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:37.361
meaning that the points farther
from the chart's center,

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:39.278
represent better value.

00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:42.080
When interpreting these radar charts,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.546
good performance looks like this

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:48.629
and poor performance looks like this.

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:52.822
The data for each outcome on this chart

00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:55.053
are from a large, randomized trial

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:58.998
involving 2,287 patients
from across the United States

00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:02.097
and Canada, comparing PCI and OMT

00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:05.669
and OMT treatment strategies,
known as the Courage trial,

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:08.522
which stands for Clinical
Outcomes Utilizing

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:12.605
Revascularization and
Aggressive Drug Evaluation.

00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:18.467
This chart illustrates the
overall Courage trial outcomes

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.960
and patient reported
health status outcomes

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.627
at six months after
enrollment in the trial.

00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:29.049
Now this chart illustrates the
same Courage outcome trials

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.895
with the same patient reported
health status outcomes

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:35.728
but three years after
enrollment in the trial.

00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:38.496
Six month,

00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:40.739
three year.

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:47.755
Notice that while PCI and OMT treatment

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:49.681
may help improve her chest pain

00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:51.673
and physical limitations when walking,

00:02:51.673 --> 00:02:53.923
these effects are
decreased as time goes on

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:55.303
and the chance for a heart attack

00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:59.470
is very similar between
the two treatment options.

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:02.313
These charts could be
a tool that Ms. Jones

00:03:02.313 --> 00:03:04.424
and her physician review to inform them

00:03:04.424 --> 00:03:06.303
of the relative benefits and costs

00:03:06.303 --> 00:03:09.040
associated with two different
treatment strategies

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.290
for Ms. Jones' coronary artery disease.

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:15.724
They could also help Ms. Jones decide

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:18.021
which treatment strategy
maximizes the outcomes

00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:20.857
that matter to her most,
because what matters to her

00:03:20.857 --> 00:03:23.173
will differ from what
matters to other patients

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:27.415
with the same disease
that her physician treats.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:28.861
Weighing and ranking these outcomes

00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:30.622
will have to be part of a discussion

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:33.622
between Ms. Jones and her physician.
