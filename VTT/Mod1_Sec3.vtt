00:00:07.502 --> 00:00:09.852
In the U.S., healthcare
costs have exploded

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:13.840
over the last few decades,
look at this graph.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.574
Each dot represents where a country ranks

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:17.839
in terms of life expectancy versus

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.886
total expenditure on health per capita.

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:25.465
Which data point do you think
represents the United States?

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:27.820
Despite spending more than
anyone else in the world

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.688
on healthcare, by a wide margin,

00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:32.568
U.S. outcomes are actually sub-par.

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:34.890
Among developed nations,
the U.S. ranks at,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.842
or near the bottom, in both
prevalence and mortality

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:41.848
for multiple diseases,
risk factors and injuries.

00:00:41.848 --> 00:00:45.765
Take a moment to answer
the following question.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:49.438
Approximately three trillion dollars

00:00:49.438 --> 00:00:51.756
are spent annually in
the U.S. on healthcare

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:54.669
equaling nearly 30% of the GDP,

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:57.323
listen to what Dr. Don Berwick,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.379
from the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.462
has to say about waste in healthcare.

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:05.797
 The choice is very stark, it is to chop

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:08.294
or it is to improve, and
if we permit chopping,

00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:10.582
I assure you, that the chopping block

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:13.471
is going to get very full.

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:16.890
The first cuts will be
to the most voiceless,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.872
the poorest among us,

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:21.890
but soon after that more and more of us,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.365
fewer health insurance
benefits, declining access,

00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:28.969
more out of pocket burdens
and growing delays,

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.981
if we do not improve, the cynics will win

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:36.316
and that is what passes the buck to us.

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:40.980
You see, if improvement is
the plan then we own the plan.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.857
The government can't do it,

00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:46.130
the payers can't do it,
the regulators can't do it,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.747
only the people who give the
care can improve the care.

00:01:50.747 --> 00:01:52.707
 Healthcare waste is anything

00:01:52.707 --> 00:01:55.544
that does not add value for the patient.

00:01:55.544 --> 00:01:58.231
This includes tests,
medications, and procedures

00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.941
that are not making people healthier.

00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:03.344
 I started to think I owe you an apology

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:06.158
for talking about costs, I mean,

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.531
I know that among the important
dimensions of quality,

00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:10.766
safety, effectiveness,
patient centeredness,

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.967
timeliness, efficiency, and equity,

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:16.883
I'm not sure any of us would
have chosen efficiency,

00:02:16.883 --> 00:02:19.312
the reduction of waste, as our favorite,

00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:22.249
it's not my favorite, but nonetheless,

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.198
it is the quality dimension of our time.

00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:28.391
I would go so far as to say this,

00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:31.194
for the next three to five years at least,

00:02:31.194 --> 00:02:33.977
the credibility and the leverage

00:02:33.977 --> 00:02:37.870
of the quality movement
is going to rise or fall

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.953
on its success in reducing
the cost of healthcare

00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:44.598
and it's even harder than that,

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:46.839
it's going to rise or fall on its success

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.930
on returning the saved
money to other uses,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.773
while improving patient experience.

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.083
 Identifying and reducing

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:56.241
areas of waste in healthcare is vital

00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:58.821
to providing value for the patient.

00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:02.904
Remember, our obligation
is to first, do no harm.
