00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:04.791
Hi ladies.

00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:05.763
 Hey there, how are you?

00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:06.883
 Good day for a walk.

00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:07.716
 Okay.

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:11.416
You know it feels really good
to be up and walking again.

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:14.989
The medication that my
cardiologist gave me was fantastic,

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:16.406
and I feel great.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.075
It's nice to be healthy.

00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:22.627
It's nice to feel good again.

00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:24.867
But I pay about $400 a month

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:28.311
out of pocket just for medications.

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:30.392
That's a lot of money.

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:33.142
It stretches my budget very thin.

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:37.293
 Like many senior
citizens, Ms. Jones is tasked

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:39.352
with taking multiple medications

00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:42.339
that put a serious strain
on her retirement budget.

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.781
Unfortunately, she is unaware that some

00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:48.141
of her brand name prescriptions,
such as Lipitor have

00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:52.472
effective cheaper generic
alternatives readily available.

00:00:52.472 --> 00:00:53.571
Switching to these could

00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:57.400
save her more than $100 every month.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.036
Medications are not Ms.
Jones' only concern.

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:02.989
Charges for tests and procedures

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.370
are also taking a large
toll on her budget.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.680
 I got the bill yesterday
for that cardiac stress test.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.513
(sighs)

00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:16.313
Unbelievable, it was $2,500, $2,500.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.117
I had no idea it would be so expensive.

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:23.203
Thankfully, it's paid for from Medicare,

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:27.938
but I think about this and I
wonder who is paying for this?

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:30.070
I mean, Medicare is paying for it for me,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.515
but who's paying Medicare,

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:34.232
and I wonder about all those people

00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:38.399
that don't have insurance
and how do they pay for it.

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:40.931
I tell ya what, if you get a bill

00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:44.640
from the hospital like I did,
you darn near have to have

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.501
an accounting degree to
be able to understand it.

00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:50.519
There are just so many charges.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.852
They charged me $18 for an aspirin, $18,

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.368
and the only reason they gave it to me

00:01:57.368 --> 00:01:58.947
was because I told them I'd forgotten

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:01.677
to take my daily dosage
before I left home.

00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:06.488
So, they gave me one
aspirin and charged me $18.

00:02:06.488 --> 00:02:08.098
I could've gotten a whole bottle

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:11.098
at the pharmacy for just five bucks.

00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:14.605
I worry because I'm on a fixed income

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:19.587
and I'm thinking, how on Earth
am I gonna pay for all this.

00:02:19.587 --> 00:02:21.592
I lose sleep over it.

00:02:21.592 --> 00:02:24.925
It's something that I have no answer to.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:30.166
I don't know if I'll be
able to afford it or not.
