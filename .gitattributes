# Created by Larry Davis Feb 21, 2017
# Added LFS endings Mar 14, 2017
#
# Different operating systems us different line endings for files.  We now have
# developers using Linux environments. This makes it necessary to properly deal
# with line endings in our repositories.
#
# This file lets Git handle the line endings and storing large files automatically.
#
# See https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/ for more
# information on what this file does and how to make edits

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
