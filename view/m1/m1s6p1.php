    <f><p>Outcomes are the results of care on the health of patients, families and populations. Beyond survival, outcomes include improved functional capabilities, reduction of pain and suffering, and ability to engage in one’s normal life.</p></f>
      <ul>
          <f><li><p>For example, if fewer people die after receiving influenza vaccines, then this mortality benefit would be an outcome measure.</p></li></f>
      <f><li><p>While mortality is an obvious outcome measure, it is not always the appropriate or even most important. Mortality is not a meaningful outcome measure for the success of a dental cleaning or wart removal, where mortality would be a travesty.  And for patients in some situations, how well they live is more important than how long they survive.</p></li></f>

                  <f><p>When a team is created around a set of patients with shared needs – such as similar circumstances and/or conditions – they share a core set of critical concerns. For example, in future modules we will discuss how care teams and practices can be formed around a condition, such as musculoskeletal pain. The clinical team can understand this set of patients and conditions and better anticipate and respond to issues, which then enhances the ability to personalize care.</p></f>
                  <f><p>A key concept of value-based health care delivery is “positive-sum competition” or “win-win” based on creating value for patients.</p></f>
