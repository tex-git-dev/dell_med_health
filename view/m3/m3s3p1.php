         <br>
         <f><p>The purpose of measuring outcomes is to enable and accelerate learning and improvement in health care delivery. If you find yourself asking, “Matters to whom?” the obvious answer is: what matters to patients. The reason for health care is to help patients and families.</p></f>
         <f><p>Facts are friendly. While physicians may worry about what outcome measurement may reveal, the opportunity to learn and improve is enabled tremendously by measuring results. When you can identify successes and failures, as well as where outcomes succeed or fail by dimension, you gain critical insight about how to improve. Putting in place measurement, feedback, and learning processes enables one patient’s outcomes to inform treatment of the next patient with similar circumstances.  Physicians who don’t track outcomes for their patients lack the feedback and tools to enable rapid learning and ongoing improvement. This points to a fundamental tenant of value-based health care: to get ever-better results for your patients and to do so efficiently.</p></f>
         <f><p>To learn how better (or worse) outcomes are being achieved, you need to analyze the processes that lead to those outcomes. Process improvement methodology is widely used in most sectors of the economy, but less often in health care. When it is used in health care, it is often applied within departmental or procedural silos, rather than across the full cycle of the patient’s care journey. This fractured view of health care slows improvement and innovation; to really understand how desired outcomes may be achieved, processes must be viewed holistically.</p></f>

        <f><p>True measurement of outcomes that are important to the patient requires a change in the focus of the questions we ask them. Maureen Bisognano from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement has popularized the shift in asking, “What matters to you?” instead of, “What’s the matter?”<sup>1</sup> <i><a target="_blank" style="color:#f4821f;" href="http://www.ihi.org/Topics/WhatMatters/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.ihi.org/Topics/WhatMatters/Pages/default.aspx</a></i></p></f>

                <f><p>One framework for considering patient outcomes, proposed by Elizabeth Teisberg and Scott Wallace from Dell Medical School, is “Capability, Comfort, and Calm.”<sup>2-5</sup></p></f>
                <f><p>Teisberg and Wallace popularized the idea that the key question about satisfaction with health care is “how are you?” rather than “how were we” or “would you recommend your physician?” They have written that, “while there are hundreds of possible performance measures for physicians, the critical questions […] are about the patients, not just about the doctor’s performance. Patient results determine quality of life and are therefore the most important measure of physician performance.”<sup>2</sup></p></f>

These measures can be collected directly from patients as easily as patient satisfaction data are collected. The difference is that we get insight about how well our patients are doing with health, rather than how they reacted to parking, wait times, or hospitality. These patient-reported outcome measures are discussed in the next section.</p></f>
